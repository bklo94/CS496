      <p>This is the following Requirements</p>
      <ul>
      <li>You need to implement a REST API</li>
      <li>User accounts are supported (ie. there is data tied to specific users that only they can see or modify) AND the account system uses 3rd party provider, there should be able to be an arbitrary number of accounts. Accounts *must* have access to some amount of account specific information that only they can either access or modify.</li>
      <li>There should be at least 2 entities and they should have at least 4 properties each</li>
      <li>It needs to meaningfully use a 3rd party API for something other than authentication (for example connecting to a stock market API to get stock data or a weather service to pull weather data)</li>
      </ul>
